Tinder Bot with a twist


The Program will open a new webpage on your browser, go to Tinder.com, log in by entering your phone number in the log in page and entering the security code sent to your phone (make sure to enable notifications on your mac). It will then infinitely swipe right on every user, closing any "It's a match" pop-ups and other advertisements until you run out of swipes. From there, it will look at the matches and begin messaging recent matches. Otherwise, it will record the responses from those you matched with and input the responses into CleverBot and communicate through CleverBot.
